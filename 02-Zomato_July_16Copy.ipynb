We were very disappointed with the service and the portion size. First we sat for 20 minutes before I had to get up and ask for someone to take our order. Not good so far! After ordering, it took 45 minutes to get our food. When the food did come, the inside of my scallops were actually cold. Strike three you're out. Overall service was marginal. We had to keep asking for more bread because the meal took so long to be served. They kept offering a slice or two of bread as we sat there. It would have been better to just leave a generous basket in the beginning and not be so stingy. Expensive and not worth the price.Menu is also somewhat limited.\",\n",

I found my entree very rich AND WAY TOO SALTY. I could not finish it. We finished with a Blueberry and Mascarpone Crespella for dessert. It was described as being a crepe BUT is was so dense. Flavorful but too heavy. The noise level in the restaurant was on the high side. It was hard to carry on a conversation.\",\n",

There was a special several course menu for a fixed price not including wine. The antipasto was cannelloni beans, coleslaw and pork. The seasoning was minimal so the beans were essentially tasteless and I could not eat the \\\"pork\\\" as it was mostly fat. An average arugala salad followed, by the best course of the dinner, a pasta, somewhat like a tortollini but much better. The light garlic sauce that was served with it was flavorful and excellent. Then we waited for at least an hour for the main course. We were there for two hours before it was served. I ordered the salmon which was just OK, nothing spectacular, my husband ordered the lamb which he enjoyed. The desserts, a chocoate torte and a cookie with blueberries and whipped cream were below average and seemed thrown together. I think the part of the dinner I least enjoyed was getting the check. OK, $100 per couple for the dinner was barely worth it, but then a 20% gratuity was added to the check. I have never heard of this for just two people!! A 20% or more gratuity is for outstanding service and meal, not what we had. I was appalled! So adding that in plus 3 glasses of average wine for $10 a pop, our bill was $156!! I never mind paying that much for an outstanding meal, but this did not qualify as such. Then the adding in of the gratuity on a party of two just angered me. We could have had a much better meal elsewhere for less. We won't be returning.\",\n",

I bragged about how they don't overcook the pasta to my guests and then was served linguine so mushy that one could not twirl it without it breaking. No one ate but a few bites. Now I have a $27 plate of leftovers that no one here will eat. What a waste! Normally, I would give this place 4.8 stars. I really should give them less than two this time. Horrible waste of my loyalty and my money...and I still want to eat dinner, just not this.\",\n",

Much of Denver's finer dining establishments suffer from horrible service which can ruin even great food, but this place is fantastic from top to bottom. I was alittle disappointed in the 52.80 menu offerings in that it was pretty much exactly the same as last year, however it was still extremely delicious; the portions are seemingly smaller than what you get at other places, but it is so very good. This place has a cozy & comfortable atmosphere, great service & great food.\",\n",

The food was pretty delicious, but not without its faults. We had duck liver pate (very good), squash tortellini with a brown butter sauce (excellent!) and beef tenderloin. The beef was excellent, but the salad it came on not so much. Soggy croutons drowned in vinaigrette - no thanks. I'd agree with other reviewers who have mentioned that it seemed as though the food sat a while before being brought to the table. The wine was good, but when spending over $130 for two people, I expect the food to be fantastic.\",\n",

After being seated, a server quickly appeared and presented us with a card imprinted with our names, the date and a congratulatory message indicating the number of years we'd been married, hand signed by the entire staff. Shortly after that, someone else brought us two complimentary glasses of champagne. The rest of the evening progressed equally wonderfully - and deliciously. \\r \\r The food at Guard and Grace was excellent, but it is the professional yet genuine service that will keep us coming back. \\r \\r P.S. I came really close to lapping up the remaining sauce from the bowl after we'd finished our Hamachi Poke appetizer. Don't visit Guard and Grace without trying this dish.\",\n",

I called at 8:30pm to place a to-go order and the manager said, \\\"Well it's 8:30pm and we close at 9:00... Are you going to be here before 9:00??\\\" I was a little shocked that he just said this, acting like I was a huge inconvenience to give them business and pick up food. I explained that I live 2 minutes down the street, and the manager said I could pick up in 15 minutes. I arrived exactly 15 minutes later and right when I walked through the door, the manager didn't even greet me or say hello when he saw me. He just said, \\\"Are you the take-out order?\\\" I said yes and he sighed and said, \\\"...Well it's not quite ready yet\\\". Wow...excuse me for considerably making sure to arrive before you close, even though there are still 4 tables in the restaurant. He should not be in customer service, let alone a manager. \\r Now the food was okay... The Chicken Parmesan was actually pretty good, but the portions are small for what you pay for. It looked like our food was thrown into a plastic container. My boyfriend even said that he felt like \\\"he was eating a TV dinner\\\". I was excited to try this place, especially with how close it is to my house and with so many positive reviews, but the manager is chasing away business. Sadly I will not be back.\",\n",

We worked with Vickie and Dusty who were pretty pleasant and easy to deal with and signed a contract for 32 guests at a predetermined price. The staff tried to add more than 12 people on the ticket adding several hundred dollars to the cost.  They were unbelievably rude when I tried to bring it to their attention and refused to work with me regarding the added people that were not there. I guess due to the fact they get to add their own gratuity they can be as rude and down right despicable as they feel. We sat down the next day and stared at our list for a HOUR and couldn't count more than 32 people that attended. The so called GM was the rudest and most unprofessional person I think I have ever delt with. Most of the guests had already left so we couldn't count everyone out to prove the number of people.  When I proceeded to leave after paying I told the GM that he can count on never getting my business again. \\u00a0He then told me he was going to call the cops if we all didn't leave... Are you serious\\u0010??  Thanks Tony Rigatoni's for the most unprofessional display of exactly how not to treat a good paying customer on my Wedding night. We have left several text messages with Vickie with no response. I also tried calling Vickie, she hung up on me immediately, answered again and said she didn't have time to talk and was extremely rude. We always frequented Tony's and live just 5 mile away. Never Again!!  I hope someone reaches out to try to discuss or we will be disputing this.\",\n",

After speaking with the owner, who graciously comped our meal, we agreed to give them one more try. Tonight we gave them that one more try and will not go back. The food is okay, but the service is just bad. Not gripey, just inattentive. We repeatedly had to ask for water refills, and our server seemed like we were more of a burden than a guest opening our wallets. Evergreen has too many other excellent restaurants. Skip Tuscany Tavern. Yes, we are locals and know the best spots in town. Tuscany Tavern is not among them.\",\n",

We usually eat at the bar and the meatballs are the best I've ever had. They seem to be made from at least two different types of meat with spinach and some other vegetables ground up in them. The marinera is quite good and the bread is homemade and delish. Good wine list, but the beer selection could use an upgrade-I like darker beers than they serve. A friendly staff which takes their lead from the owner add to the atmosphere. A cozy place!\",\n",

We got lucky here and were seated right away without a res (not a good sign). Service was attentive, slightly overbearing and uncomfortable though. The kitchen is definitely a bit slow as other online reviews mention. The menu has some exciting stuff. They do half orders of pasta. Now, at any Italian restaurant I've been to where half orders are an option, it's because the full order is too much for one person. Here, it's the opposite, the half order of our dish was just a couple bites and we were told it's because \\\"the cheeses are really expensive on this one.\\\" Well, then double the price, or don't offer half order for that one, or use a cheaper cheese! What's the point of putting an incomplete meal in front of me? OK, so definitely worth a try, I'll give it one more shot, but some advice for the owners if they want to survive this competitive business- give the bread for free, not $4, or cut it to $2, increase your pasta portion size, and offer a standard red sauce veggie pasta on the menu, can't be too fancy with every item, not in Denver. Dessert was fantastic.\",\n",

We were very disappointed with the service and the portion size. First we sat for 20 minutes before I had to get up and ask for someone to take our order. Not good so far! After ordering, it took 45 minutes to get our food. When the food did come, the inside of my scallops were actually cold. Strike three you're out. Overall service was marginal. We had to keep asking for more bread because the meal took so long to be served. They kept offering a slice or two of bread as we sat there. It would have been better to just leave a generous basket in the beginning and not be so stingy. Expensive and not worth the price.Menu is also somewhat limited.\",\n",

We each started with a Prosciutto di Parma salad. It was very good. For my entree, I chose the Ricotta Cavatelli (which was highly recommended by our server). I found my entree very rich AND WAY TOO SALTY. I could not finish it. We finished with a Blueberry and Mascarpone Crespella for dessert. It was described as being a crepe BUT is was so dense. Flavorful but too heavy. The noise level in the restaurant was on the high side. It was hard to carry on a conversation.',\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Disappointed. I had high expectations after seeing some the reviews. I was sadly disappointed. We had dinner last night, Valentines day. There was a special several course menu for a fixed price not including wine. The antipasto was cannelloni beans, coleslaw and pork. The seasoning was minimal so the beans were essentially tasteless and I could not eat the \"pork\" as it was mostly fat. An average arugala salad followed, by the best course of the dinner, a pasta, somewhat like a tortollini but much better. The light garlic sauce that was served with it was flavorful and excellent. Then we waited for at least an hour for the main course. We were there for two hours before it was served. I ordered the salmon which was just OK, nothing spectacular, my husband ordered the lamb which he enjoyed. The desserts, a chocoate torte and a cookie with blueberries and whipped cream were below average and seemed thrown together. I think the part of the dinner I least enjoyed was getting the check. OK, $100 per couple for the dinner was barely worth it, but then a 20% gratuity was added to the check. I have never heard of this for just two people!! A 20% or more gratuity is for outstanding service and meal, not what we had. I was appalled! So adding that in plus 3 glasses of average wine for $10 a pop, our bill was $156!! I never mind paying that much for an outstanding meal, but this did not qualify as such. Then the adding in of the gratuity on a party of two just angered me. We could have had a much better meal elsewhere for less. We won\\'t be returning.',\n",

The sauce was a salt lick without any other substantial flavor. So salty that the tomatoes were overpowered. I bragged about how they don't overcook the pasta to my guests and then was served linguine so mushy that one could not twirl it without it breaking. No one ate but a few bites. Now I have a $27 plate of leftovers that no one here will eat. What a waste! Normally, I would give this place 4.8 stars. I really should give them less than two this time. Horrible waste of my loyalty and my money...and I still want to eat dinner, just not this.\",\n",

The garlic knots are pure deliciousness along with a Peroni beer.  We had antipasti misti and mussels for apps, both were well presented. Next we had the family style Caesar Salad and a bottle of Syrah, excellent pairing. For the main courses we all shared Raviolis, Chicken Piccata and Meatballs in vodka sauce. Everything was family style and huge portions. If going to Carmine's remember it's all about family style, long conversations and great food and wine. Perfect Italian Tradition!\",\n",

I've lived in Italy twice and this is one of the few U.S. restaurants I've experienced that remind me of authentic Italian food. On top of that, the server, Luis, gave us the best service I've ever received at a restaurant. He was delightfully flexible in responding to our requests and made us feel special and as if he enjoyed every moment of serving us.\",\n",

Much of Denver's finer dining establishments suffer from horrible service which can ruin even great food, but this place is fantastic from top to bottom. I was alittle disappointed in the 52.80 menu offerings in that it was pretty much exactly the same as last year, however it was still extremely delicious; the portions are seemingly smaller than what you get at other places, but it is so very good. This place has a cozy & comfortable atmosphere, great service & great food.\",\n",

The food was pretty delicious, but not without its faults. We had duck liver pate (very good), squash tortellini with a brown butter sauce (excellent!) and beef tenderloin. The beef was excellent, but the salad it came on not so much. Soggy croutons drowned in vinaigrette - no thanks. I'd agree with other reviewers who have mentioned that it seemed as though the food sat a while before being brought to the table. The wine was good, but when spending over $130 for two people, I expect the food to be fantastic.\",\n",

After being seated, a server quickly appeared and presented us with a card imprinted with our names, the date and a congratulatory message indicating the number of years we\\'d been married, hand signed by the entire staff. Shortly after that, someone else brought us two complimentary glasses of champagne. The rest of the evening progressed equally wonderfully - and deliciously. \\r \\r The food at Guard and Grace was excellent, but it is the professional yet genuine service that will keep us coming back. \\r \\r P.S. I came really close to lapping up the remaining sauce from the bowl after we\\'d finished our Hamachi Poke appetizer. Don\\'t visit Guard and Grace without trying this dish.',\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Rude Manager. This was my first experience with Nonna\\'s Bistro and the manager pretty much ruined it for me. I called at 8:30pm to place a to-go order and the manager said, \"Well it\\'s 8:30pm and we close at 9:00... Are you going to be here before 9:00??\" I was a little shocked that he just said this, acting like I was a huge inconvenience to give them business and pick up food. I explained that I live 2 minutes down the street, and the manager said I could pick up in 15 minutes. I arrived exactly 15 minutes later and right when I walked through the door, the manager didn\\'t even greet me or say hello when he saw me. He just said, \"Are you the take-out order?\" I said yes and he sighed and said, \"...Well it\\'s not quite ready yet\". Wow...excuse me for considerably making sure to arrive before you close, even though there are still 4 tables in the restaurant. He should not be in customer service, let alone a manager. \\r Now the food was okay... The Chicken Parmesan was actually pretty good, but the portions are small for what you pay for. It looked like our food was thrown into a plastic container. My boyfriend even said that he felt like \"he was eating a TV dinner\". I was excited to try this place, especially with how close it is to my house and with so many positive reviews, but the manager is chasing away business. Sadly I will not be back.',\n",

       "        'review_text': \"I unfortunately made the poor decision to use Tony Rigatoni's for my wedding dinner venue because of how close it was to the church and we eat there often and have always enjoyed the food.  We worked with Vickie and Dusty who were pretty pleasant and easy to deal with and signed a contract for 32 guests at a predetermined price. The staff tried to add more than 12 people on the ticket adding several hundred dollars to the cost.  They were unbelievably rude when I tried to bring it to their attention and refused to work with me regarding the added people that were not there. I guess due to the fact they get to add their own gratuity they can be as rude and down right despicable as they feel. We sat down the next day and stared at our list for a HOUR and couldn't count more than 32 people that attended. The so called GM was the rudest and most unprofessional person I think I have ever delt with. Most of the guests had already left so we couldn't count everyone out to prove the number of people.  When I proceeded to leave after paying I told the GM that he can count on never getting my business again. \\xa0He then told me he was going to call the cops if we all didn't leave... Are you serious\\x10??  Thanks Tony Rigatoni's for the most unprofessional display of exactly how not to treat a good paying customer on my Wedding night. We have left several text messages with Vickie with no response. I also tried calling Vickie, she hung up on me immediately, answered again and said she didn't have time to talk and was extremely rude. We always frequented Tony's and live just 5 mile away. Never Again!!  I hope someone reaches out to try to discuss or we will be disputing this.\",\n",

Last time (a couple of months back) as we entertained friends from out of town the food arrived nearly 1.5 hours after we ordered. After speaking with the owner, who graciously comped our meal, we agreed to give them one more try. Tonight we gave them that one more try and will not go back. The food is okay, but the service is just bad. Not gripey, just inattentive. We repeatedly had to ask for water refills, and our server seemed like we were more of a burden than a guest opening our wallets. Evergreen has too many other excellent restaurants. Skip Tuscany Tavern. Yes, we are locals and know the best spots in town. Tuscany Tavern is not among them.\",\n",

The marinera is quite good and the bread is homemade and delish. Good wine list, but the beer selection could use an upgrade-I like darker beers than they serve. A friendly staff which takes their lead from the owner add to the atmosphere. A cozy place!\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'We came to Coperta on a Saturday night with a hankering to try a brand new restaurant in Denver, having being turned away from 2 others with no reservation. We got lucky here and were seated right away without a res (not a good sign). Service was attentive, slightly overbearing and uncomfortable though. The kitchen is definitely a bit slow as other online reviews mention. The menu has some exciting stuff. They do half orders of pasta. Now, at any Italian restaurant I\\'ve been to where half orders are an option, it\\'s because the full order is too much for one person. Here, it\\'s the opposite, the half order of our dish was just a couple bites and we were told it\\'s because \"the cheeses are really expensive on this one.\" Well, then double the price, or don\\'t offer half order for that one, or use a cheaper cheese! What\\'s the point of putting an incomplete meal in front of me? OK, so definitely worth a try, I\\'ll give it one more shot, but some advice for the owners if they want to survive this competitive business- give the bread for free, not $4, or cut it to $2, increase your pasta portion size, and offer a standard red sauce veggie pasta on the menu, can\\'t be too fancy with every item, not in Denver. Dessert was fantastic.',\n",

Our luncheon party was a huge and memorable success - a three hour lunch made memorable with everyone satisfied faces because of the awesome food!. Did I mention the desserts - to die for!  Thank you so much Roses's cooks and staff! We only wish we lived closer to you!! Barbara and Wally and 13 new friends!!\",\n",

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  No complaints here. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all of the brews on tap, and the atmosphere is chalk full of inside jokes and references from the Academy. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Hm... this is where things went a tad bit south. The beer on tap was well-priced, running around $6 for a pint, but the food was pretty outrageous. I wasn't overly hungry, but I decided to grab an appetizer of sliders, and was a bit shocked when I found them priced at a cool $9.00. $9.00? For the pictured sliders?  No, that's simply too much. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Meh. I wanted to love these sliders, and gave my friend's order of jalapeno poppers a sample hoping I would love those as well. Sadly? I really didn't like either. I know breweries tend to focus on the brew at the expense of food, but that doesn't have to be the case. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Good local brew and a solid atmosphere can't overshadow bad, overpriced food. No Star Granted.\",\n",

He knew the specials by heart and provided excellent recommendations to suit our palettes.  The portions were spot-on with freshly baked bread accompaniment.  With any restaurant that serves freshly made pasta, you will have an opportunity to sip wine and enjoy your date's company.  This is a great date night location or venue for a small group of friends.  It appears they also do catered events.  Everyone's food including my own was absolutely divine.

After we were seated it was 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Then when we finally got our drinks they were wrong. Mine had salt on the glass instead of sugar. Instead of offering to get me the correct drink the waiter tried to wipe the salt off! We finally got the appetizer and it was OK. The salads were good. But the main entrees were mediocre at best. After we got the entrees not once did our waiter come back and see if we needed anything or if we wanted dessert. Since this was a birthday dinner we were planning on ordering dessert but after being ignored by our waiter we decided to go somewhere else! Once we had finished our meals we literally were there 45 minutes before we got the check! We had to ask another waiter to get our waiter so we could get the check! We had been here about 20 years ago and it used to be a wonderful place but not any more...\",\n",

As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted and made to feel welcome. The atmosphere is nice although the space is a little cramped. There was a small wait so we decided to grab a drink and appetizer at the bar. The drinks were generous in portion and the Salumi e Formaggi was just the right size for the 3 of us.\\r \\r We were soon seated at our table and the server was great and quite friendly. He recommended the Pollo Marsala to me and said that \\\"People come back for the Marsala.\\\" My friend ordered the Gamperoni Alfredo and his girlfriend go the Gnocchi Genovese. After we had ordered the waiter brought out some fresh bread and herbed olive oil to dip in. The bread was okay. I get the feeling that it wasn't fresh baked as he claimed and it was missing that \\\"from the oven to the table\\\" flavor. The olive oil, while good, only had a sprinkling of herbs so when you dipped your bread all you tasted was the olive oil.\\r \\r We didn't have to wait long for out entrees. I wish we would have though if it would have meant that they would have seasoned them. I've read the other reviews here on Urbanspoon and they're right. The sauces are very watery. Not just my Marsala but the Alfredo dishes as well. And I have to ask, have they ever heard of salt and pepper? There was no seasoning to be had on my dish and my fellow diners said the same about theirs. I would also think for the prices they were charging that the pasta would have at least been fresh. Unfortunately, if it was it didn't taste like it. \\r \\r After the disappointment that was the main course we did order desert. I guess that was the one high light as my friend, who's mother is straight off the boat italian and makes them by hand, said the Cannoli's were very good. The chocolate cake.....dry.\\r \\r All in all it was a very disappointing and over priced dining experience. I should have gone with my gut and just drove the extra 10 minutes to Paravicini's.\",\n",

A great pizza can't have too much cheese in relation to the crust. It can't have too much sauce in relation to the overall toppings. Average ingredients put together in the proper way will make a bad pizza good, but it won't make a great pizza. Marilyn's has perfected the relative proportions on their pizza, and this alone gives them a leg up on just about everyone else, but the ingredients....oh god the ingredients. Truly outstanding.\\r \\r If Marilyn's fails it'll fail due to the poor service which is, to be honest, not very good.

We had previously had drinks with salad and pizza in the lobby bar and it was quite nice, this visit started the same. I started with a fennel, pear and celery salad. It was very nice, crisp, with well balanced flavors. My husband had the house made ricotta with truffle oil, ricotta was very good, truffle oil added depth of flavor and ground pepper just the right spice. It was the main course that was the real letdown. I had pumpkin ravioli with a side of roasted cauliflower. The pumpkin ravioli were nicely done, but were served swimming in way too much brown butter sauce The cauliflower was not cooked through enough, but burnt on the outside. My husband had the cod with a side of pumpkin. The cod did not seem very fresh, It smelled way too fishy even before it was set down on the table. It was somewhat dry and over seasoned, both salt and pepper. It was served on a bed of red cabbage and cured ham, which turned out to be mostly fat. The pumpkin were small, roasted sections with the skin still on. Was unsure, but the ones that were cooked well were tender and moist. Unfortunately only about half were well cooked. Overall pretty disappointing for a $100 dinner.\",\n",

Try this amazing pizza joint in Old Colorado City! The area caters to the more liberal \\\"free-spirits\\\" and appears to be very dog-friendly.  Plan extra time to find parking anywhere in this area. Pizzeria Rustica is a small, quaint pizza restaurant that serves up an assortment of pizzas, liquors, salads, and Italiano appetizers and desserts.  Since everything is made to order and fresh, you will have plenty of time to converse with friends or impress you date. My soul-mate and I enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday evening around 730pm and it was full of diverse guests.  Families, children, twosomes, and a couple dogs in the patio seating area.  Although reservations are not needed, if you expect to bring large party of friends or are celebrating an event--I would call to secure seating! The host was sweet and accommodating and promptly sat us on the patio as requested.  The waitress Chelsea was patient and knowledgeable about the menu and was hustling to ensure she catered to her assigned tables.  Her recommendations were on point and I started my night off right with the Raspberry Cosmopolitan & the roasted olives and nuts on flatbread.  Delicious!  The aroma here is divine...garlic, cheese and pizza crust!  As soon as our pizza were served, the patrons beside us had googly-eyes for the delicious pizza and wanted to know what we ordered.  Folks, the pizzas were so flavorful--one of the best I have had--with fresh veggies & savory spices. You will have a couple slices leftover for a night-time snack.  Desserts are all Italiano-based so much of it is coffee-flavored and exotic. Definitely a must try for Colorado Springs!\",\n",

While the food's blandness is comparable to anything found in public school cafeterias or nursing-homes, this establishment is a great place to take a large group of people with undiscerning taste buds as the servers are amiable and patient.

I grew up working in excellent Italian places, so I might be a little hard to please.  I will say they always have exceptional service and I have always had good meals.  The squid ink pasta and lobster was my favorite.  Of note were the crab cake appetizers.  After living for a bit in Maryland, I quit ordering crab when not back there.  I took a gamble and ordered the crab cakes tonight.  Pretty sure they weren't blue crab, but outside of Baltimore, they were absolutely the best I've ever had; fresh real chunk crab perfectly cooked.  All in all, a solid date night spot.\",\n",

We all know the old saying: \\\"you can fool some of the people some of the time...\\\" Well, this time Biaggi's Ristorante Italiano is not fooling me. This wildly popular Italian style restaurant draws a lot of out of town visitors, lunchtime business diners, and even small group patrons. It is packed on the weekends, in particular. Located in the convenient oasis of The Shoppes at Briargate among the the other themed chains and popular shopping storefronts, is what seems to be a venerable location for an always dependable meal. Sadly, things have changed. The greeting staff, comprised of two or three young ladies focused more on creating an air of exclusivity rather than getting folks to their table as efficiently as possible, are a bit too full of themselves for this typically laid-back Colorado clientele. The ambiance is somewhat upscale, though a little sterile with that distinctive \\\"shopping mall\\\" formulaic feel. I have been here about ten times over the past several years, and have noticed a decidedly steep decline in service and food quality. My wife and I were here for a 'pre-Valentine rush' dinner, and so were most other diners. Our server, though genuinely well-intentioned, was stilted, confused, and struggling the entire evening. He took forever to bring us some water, then our drinks, and even jammed us with our soup and salads all at once. Clearly, he was not properly trained. I ordered the 'Olive Me' martini with stuffed olives and Bombay Gin. It was way under portioned, barely reaching the middle of the glass, and missing the added vermouth I requested. The olives were a nice touch though, as all three were filled with either blue cheese, anchovies, or pepperoni. It was a welcomed twist on my usual three olive standby. My wife had a dry Californian Pinot Grigio that she thoroughly enjoyed. The special soup for the evening was a wonderful white asparagus with pur\\u00e9ed carrots and root vegetables in a perfectly balanced cream base. Understated, bright and flavorful, it was the best part of the meal. The Caesar salad was heavily dressed, loaded with shaved Parmesan and most memorable for the undertone of biting and bitter spice from a strong, peppery chili sauce of some kind. Perhaps it appeals to the nouveau palate, but not ours. My wife's sea scallops were served seared and aligned on a tiny layer of creamy risotto, flaked with crabmeat, but unfortunately ringed with an overpowering, super garlicky basil pesto that supplanted any hope of the scallop flavor from shining through. It was a heavy-handed, clumsy attempt at what should have been a better contrived dish. My eggplant Parmesan was equally disappointing. The large slices of eggplant were so thick that they did not cook through and were still green on the edges, and way over battered and too chewy to eat. The so-called tomato cream sauce, was super thick, pasty, and brash with a distinctive acidic flavor, but void of any actual cream. The topping Parmesan cheese spent too much time under the Salamander Broiler and was charred to black, instead of a more appealing light brown. Even the side of their signature Sicilian meatballs were very tough, undercooked with pink sausage pork vividly evident in the middle of one, and each needing to be ground more finely during the preparation. The concept of using what was an admittedly delicious, spicy sausage base, was ruined by terrible execution of a simple rustic meatball. The result was a complete fail on this dish. Our bill was $75 before tip, and the meal turned out to be frustratingly mediocre for a place that purports to serve sophisticated Italian fare. Others continue to flock to Biaggi's, so it is entirely possible we could be missing something in the translation. But I doubt it. Salut!\",\n",

There were 5 of us, we were seated at a table for 4 with a chair on the end which put me into the aisle with people walking by bumping me constantly. Put in our order and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive, during which time the server and the manager came by and apologized multiple times without us complaining about the wait. Food was marginal, I ordered the \\\"late night burger\\\" which was advertised as \\\"smothered\\\" with chile verde, when it arrived there was barely any on it, certainly not smothered. I sent the server back for more twice before it was acceptable. Then the gift card I had was run incorrectly so I had to pay cash out of pocket for no reason. I won't go back to BJ's at any point in the future. Not worth the trouble or expense.\",\n",

Recently we had a couple complain about us saying we where showing to much PDA, and the manager came out and told us we needed to stop. I showed up after her and gave her a kiss when I walked in and sat down. That was as much PDA we did. She was pissed and got mad saying she would never go back. The only reason why we wouldn't go back would be because of the management. The food is great. I love there beer and there bar tenders.\",\n",

The place was clean and neat. From there the expeeience falls off the cliff. There were 4 of us and we all spent a great deal of time looking over the large menu. I, as is my norm, wanted to go straight for the signature of the place. It actually took some reading to figure out it was a deep dish pizza type place. I ordered BJ's favorite mini and added a Cesar salad. For being a signature dish I was grealty disappointed. There is no sauce, most if the fillings seemed under cooked and had no real flavor at all. It honestly paired right up there with a dry sandwich. The salad was okay bust some of the lettuce was slimy. My wife ordered the broccoli cheese soup. It was barely Luke warm and truthfully tasted like microwaved canned soup. By her third spoon it was cold. My sons opted for differnt choices one with a steak and the other a chicken club sandwich... lets just say the veggies and fries were cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like food service boil in a bag type and the fries had a hint of fish to them. All toll we spent $64 (no alcohol) before tip and honestly we all left feeling a bit peckish. Just wasn't impressed at all. My advice, hit noodles and company across the parking lot for an $8 thai hot pot or buttered noodles.\",\n",

Breaking into that cultural echelon is not easy for new businesses and product lines. BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is awfully familiar and reminiscent of several other similar brew pubs and houses I have frequented lately. It is built in a warehouse structure with faux side panels, garage door windows and partitions and an industrial ceiling. There is a decidedly recurring theme of the obligatory list of six or eight selections of house Pilsners, IPA's, Porters and Lagers, each described by bitterness and hoppyness and color and caramel. BTW, am I the only one who thinks $7 for a unremarkable draught beer is bit much? Methinks the charm and luster of all these supposedly exclusive craft beers has worn off, as they are becoming rather ordinary and overpriced. I can get an equally satisfying six pack of Sam Adams' for a few dollars more. The related menu typically offers some peppery calamari, spicy fries, cheesy chips, creamy pastas, and smoky meats. They all have variations on the same theme, with desperately few offering their own opus to a memorable experience. Sure, these places are fun and sociable, but they have also become routine and predictable as a springtime snow fall in Denver. I'll go down the list to satisfy those who want to know how the rundown of pub food actually measured up. The calamari, with marinara and horseradish dippers were fine, salty, crispy and made fresh to order--though a bit skimpy in portion for the price. The fettuccine with chicken and broccoli and the shrimp scampi with linguine are adequate, perfectly satisfying but certainly nothing special. The New York sirloin is a fair price and can be paired with some very good Brussels sprouts with bacon lardons. The burgers are mediocre and cooked properly, while the pulled pork is a reheated, though sufficiently tangy sandwich topped with limp onion strings and a conflictingly sweeter commercial bbq sauce that seems to clash with the more vinegary pork sopping marinade. Each of those are sided with joltingly fishy tasting skinny fries that are served cold, meaning they are not enjoyable at all. They need to rotate the fryolator oil. The all you can eat soup and salad for eight bucks is good, but the tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad was not made consistently: the first one was adroitly dressed with basil, a drizzle of a fine syrupy balsamic, and some fresh greens; the second was overpowered with an ill-advised array of thyme, cilantro and other off-putting herbs. There was no buffalo mozzarella added, and the tomatoes were not as flavorful on the second round. It was horrible, and simply not consistent. Someone has not been trained properly, to include the server who put it on our table without challenging the line cook regarding the inconsistency. The clam chowder, though jammed full of clam bits, was a little too thick with a flour based roux. The kid's pan pizza was doughy and had no sauce or topping worth mentioning. Subsequently, BJRBH barely rises above the most basic of standards for acceptable, and is simply another average franchise that will do if your hungry. Whatever.\",\n",

Due to the mixed reviews we wanted to take a look at their buffet before deciding wether or not we wanted to stay and eat here (not to mention that one of us is a vegetarian). We went in and saw that there were 3 peices of a very stale looking cheese pizza and some other pasta dishes that looked as if there had been there since lunch, we were there around 6pm. We decided not to eat there and went out to our car, to look for another place to eat. It was then that this guy came out and started starting at us. This person then said \\\"I noticed you guys left\\\". I said \\\"Yes we didn't see any pizzas and don't have time to wait and noticed 4 people in the restaurant and decided to eat somewhere else\\\". It was then that this guy started yelling, and approaching the open window of my vehicle, that the other people ordered their own pizzas and he was making more. Again, we didn't have time. Then preceded to insult the Navy plates that are on my vehicle, and started screaming that Air Force is better. Not even sure where that came from, but whatever. Good luck to anyone that decides to eat at this establishment.\",\n",

I called and ordered this for carry out, go to pickup my order and there was a balance, the owner wanted to charge me gratuity for my carry out order, was mad I got it for carry out, said that was an error and wanted to charge me over the amount it said it was valued at.

      "                                \"review_text\": \"Italy is one of my favorite countries and I could easily pick up and live in the Italian countryside. The hustle and bustle of Rome, the wonderful art of Florence and I have been lucky enough to spend weeks in Tuscany. I have heard the name Dat's Italian from friends and have seen it pop up on numerous social media sites lately so we headed out for a nice dinner...or so we were hoping!  \\u00a0It was busy for a Wednesday night and we were told about a 20 minute wait which was not a problem. It was a glorious night out so we window shopped in Old Colorado City. When we returned they were just getting our table ready. The inside is old school 1980 style Italian decor, fairly dark, with not a lot of tables. We were seated in the back at a very tiny round table. My husband had decided on a Peroni before we even walked in the door and I settled on a nice glass of red wine. Of course they were out of Peroni. He then ordered his usual go to a Coors Light (no judging in this brew happy town haha). They were also out of that. Already a bit of a let down. He did get a Coors Banquet beer and was fine with that. My Chianti was delicious!  \\u00a0We knew we were going to start with the Pignoli (aka pine nut) Meatballs. The Pignoli is an edible seed from pine cones and are used in cooking and baking and have a unique slightly nutty, slightly floral bite. We were hoping to get our appetizer first but instead got our Caesar salad first as apparently the kitchen had thrown out our ticket. Skip the Caesar here...we had spring greens (not the hearty, crunchy romaine) and it was topped with red onion and tomato (odd for a Caesar), had almost no dressing with croutons and shaved Parmesan. The one bite that I did have with dressing had a good anchovy flavor but the rest of the salad was borderline dry with no taste and too warm.  The meatballs did arrive and were the only high point of the meal. The meatballs were tender, moist, well seasoned with the wonderful flavor of the pine nuts. The red sauce was also amazing with fresh tomatoes withjust enough acidity with a hint of sweetness and the fresh basil put this over the top. They also had just enough cheese on top for that silky mouth feel. These were top notch meatballs. I just wish I would have stopped here.  I decided on the Shrimp Puttanesca, which translates literally In Italian to \\\"spaghetti in the style of a prostitute\\\".\\u00a0 Our waiter asked if I liked spicy and of course I said yes....extra spicy! The dish traditionally has anchovy, garlic, Kalamata olives, red pepper flakes, fresh diced tomatoes, capers, and parsley and this one also had Pecorino cheese,lemon and onions and tossed with Bowtie pasta instead of the traditional spaghetti, which was fine. I was first informed they ran out of Bowtie pasta. I selected the fresh pasta instead. I could smell the garlic from the kitchen...a smell I love. Until I took my first bite. I love salt and garlic but the salt and garlic on this dish was inedible. My husband took a bite and spit it out. I was SO glad I didn't salt it first figuring it wouldn't need any with the capers, anchovy and kalamata olives but salt it someone did. The garlic overpowered everything on this dish. I did eat 3 bites, no heat, and called it a day. The shrimp I did taste were cooked perfectly but they had soaked up all that salt and garlic. It was $20 down the drain and only the 2nd dish in history that I declared inedible. HORRIBLE!  After reading review after review on the lasagna and on the recommendation of our waiter that is what my husband ordered. We certainly didn't declare it the best lasagna ever but it was average. The tomato sauce was the best part but way too much cheese (and it takes a lot to write down those words) and the overcooked pasta made it for a very one note dish. Had the pasta been al dente for that nice contrasting bite with all the soft cheese that would have upped the game a bit, but instead it sat like a ton of bricks, but hey, at least it was edible!  \\u00a0We were disappointed to say the least.\",\n",

The Jambalaya is almost $17 but based on portion size and flavor it shouldn't cost more then $14. The pizza is average - flavors are all really great but crust is kinda dry. Macaroni bites suck! They are not even close to the Cheesecake Factory ones. We really enjoy all the pasta dishes and would consider CPK a place we would eat at every few months.\",\n",

We stopped going there because my wife and I considered the food overpriced and underwhelming. Generally, that remains our impression of CPK 's current offerings. The field green salad was underdressed, bland, and needed some tang. The sweet walnuts were very good though. The Bolognese was skimpy on the sauce, too light and bright for what supposed to be a hearty, rich dish. It had no depth of flavor, lacked garlic, and the pasta was actually way too al dente and almost inedible. The wild mushroom pizza was dominated with fresh basil and a pungent wild mushroom flavor. It was surprisingly bold but did not balance with the near tasteless crust. The five cheese pizza was good, but also needed some salt and pepper and maybe some oregano to round it out. I tried their pricey sangria and it was refreshing..not to mention pricey. CPK's prices are still astronomical for what they serve you, and we were once again reminded why we do not like the food, nor consider their prices a value for the average family. We will not return anytime soon.\",\n",

You can expect a trendy interior, a large, varied menu and a formal waitstaff. \\r \\r The CPK specializes in \\\"personalized\\\" pizza's that ring in around 12\\\" in diameter and have toppings you wouldn't normally find at other pizza places. Just look at my Thai pizza for example. No tomato sauce here, instead, it's a peanut sauce. It comes with scallions, chicken, sprouts, etc. It was pretty tasty with all of the flavors going nicely and reminding me of, guess what, Pad Thai.\\r \\r My wife's 3 topping pizza was also pretty good. The sauce was just enough and had the traditional California style sweet sauce. The sausage had nice, noticeable fennel seeds in it, which made it seem more premium.\\r \\r I like their traditional crust, which was crunchy and very chewy with a slight hint of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed it. And best of all, it wasn't dusted with that damn corn meal like Extreme Pizza does.\\r \\r I'd recommend CPK to people who would insist on a chain restaurant, but also because I don't believe there is a local pizza joint that specializes in California Style pizza in the Springs.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"The military veins within Colorado Springs run deep, so when I heard that a group of Academy alum started up a brewery by the new theatre, I had no choice but to check it out.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  No complaints here. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all of the brews on tap, and the atmosphere is chalk full of inside jokes and references from the Academy. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Hm... this is where things went a tad bit south. The beer on tap was well-priced, running around $6 for a pint, but the food was pretty outrageous. I wasn't overly hungry, but I decided to grab an appetizer of sliders, and was a bit shocked when I found them priced at a cool $9.00. $9.00? For the pictured sliders?  No, that's simply too much. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Meh. I wanted to love these sliders, and gave my friend's order of jalapeno poppers a sample hoping I would love those as well. Sadly? I really didn't like either. I know breweries tend to focus on the brew at the expense of food, but that doesn't have to be the case. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Good local brew and a solid atmosphere can't overshadow bad, overpriced food. No Star Granted.\",\n",

He knew the specials by heart and provided excellent recommendations to suit our palettes.  The portions were spot-on with freshly baked bread accompaniment.  With any restaurant that serves freshly made pasta, you will have an opportunity to sip wine and enjoy your date's company.  This is a great date night location or venue for a small group of friends.  It appears they also do catered events.  Everyone's food including my own was absolutely divine.  Can't wait to go back for more!\",\n",

Not a good idea...\\r We had dinner reservations but still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated as there was no one at the seating area when we arrived. After we were seated it was 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Then when we finally got our drinks they were wrong. Mine had salt on the glass instead of sugar. Instead of offering to get me the correct drink the waiter tried to wipe the salt off! We finally got the appetizer and it was OK. The salads were good. But the main entrees were mediocre at best. After we got the entrees not once did our waiter come back and see if we needed anything or if we wanted dessert. Since this was a birthday dinner we were planning on ordering dessert but after being ignored by our waiter we decided to go somewhere else! Once we had finished our meals we literally were there 45 minutes before we got the check! We had to ask another waiter to get our waiter so we could get the check! We had been here about 20 years ago and it used to be a wonderful place but not any more...',\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Don\\'t Bother. Looking for a place to eat last Saturday night, my friends and I decided on Fratelli\\'s on Nevada. As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted and made to feel welcome. The atmosphere is nice although the space is a little cramped. There was a small wait so we decided to grab a drink and appetizer at the bar. The drinks were generous in portion and the Salumi e Formaggi was just the right size for the 3 of us.\\r \\r We were soon seated at our table and the server was great and quite friendly. He recommended the Pollo Marsala to me and said that \"People come back for the Marsala.\" My friend ordered the Gamperoni Alfredo and his girlfriend go the Gnocchi Genovese. After we had ordered the waiter brought out some fresh bread and herbed olive oil to dip in. The bread was okay. I get the feeling that it wasn\\'t fresh baked as he claimed and it was missing that \"from the oven to the table\" flavor. The olive oil, while good, only had a sprinkling of herbs so when you dipped your bread all you tasted was the olive oil.\\r \\r We didn\\'t have to wait long for out entrees. I wish we would have though if it would have meant that they would have seasoned them. I\\'ve read the other reviews here on Urbanspoon and they\\'re right. The sauces are very watery. Not just my Marsala but the Alfredo dishes as well. And I have to ask, have they ever heard of salt and pepper? There was no seasoning to be had on my dish and my fellow diners said the same about theirs. I would also think for the prices they were charging that the pasta would have at least been fresh. Unfortunately, if it was it didn\\'t taste like it. \\r \\r After the disappointment that was the main course we did order desert. I guess that was the one high light as my friend, who\\'s mother is straight off the boat italian and makes them by hand, said the Cannoli\\'s were very good. The chocolate cake.....dry.\\r \\r All in all it was a very disappointing and over priced dining experience. I should have gone with my gut and just drove the extra 10 minutes to Paravicini\\'s.',\n",

I cannot say enough good things about this pizza.\\r \\r What makes Marilyn's pizza better than the rest are the proportions. A great pizza can't have too much cheese in relation to the crust. It can't have too much sauce in relation to the overall toppings. Average ingredients put together in the proper way will make a bad pizza good, but it won't make a great pizza. Marilyn's has perfected the relative proportions on their pizza, and this alone gives them a leg up on just about everyone else, but the ingredients....oh god the ingredients. Truly outstanding.\\r \\r If Marilyn's fails it'll fail due to the poor service which is, to be honest, not very good. But I just can't rate a restaurant with this kind of pizza perfection as anything less than five stars.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Broadmoor's New Restaurant Falls Flat. We ate dinner at Ristorante Del Lago last Friday night with expectations for a good meal. We had previously had drinks with salad and pizza in the lobby bar and it was quite nice, this visit started the same. I started with a fennel, pear and celery salad. It was very nice, crisp, with well balanced flavors. My husband had the house made ricotta with truffle oil, ricotta was very good, truffle oil added depth of flavor and ground pepper just the right spice. It was the main course that was the real letdown. I had pumpkin ravioli with a side of roasted cauliflower. The pumpkin ravioli were nicely done, but were served swimming in way too much brown butter sauce The cauliflower was not cooked through enough, but burnt on the outside. My husband had the cod with a side of pumpkin. The cod did not seem very fresh, It smelled way too fishy even before it was set down on the table. It was somewhat dry and over seasoned, both salt and pepper. It was served on a bed of red cabbage and cured ham, which turned out to be mostly fat. The pumpkin were small, roasted sections with the skin still on. Was unsure, but the ones that were cooked well were tender and moist. Unfortunately only about half were well cooked. Overall pretty disappointing for a $100 dinner.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Are you craving pizza but don\\'t want to eat cardboard?!? Not willing to settle for fast food pizza?  Try this amazing pizza joint in Old Colorado City! The area caters to the more liberal \"free-spirits\" and appears to be very dog-friendly.  Plan extra time to find parking anywhere in this area. Pizzeria Rustica is a small, quaint pizza restaurant that serves up an assortment of pizzas, liquors, salads, and Italiano appetizers and desserts.  Since everything is made to order and fresh, you will have plenty of time to converse with friends or impress you date. My soul-mate and I enjoyed dinner here on a Saturday evening around 730pm and it was full of diverse guests.  Families, children, twosomes, and a couple dogs in the patio seating area.  Although reservations are not needed, if you expect to bring large party of friends or are celebrating an event--I would call to secure seating! The host was sweet and accommodating and promptly sat us on the patio as requested.  The waitress Chelsea was patient and knowledgeable about the menu and was hustling to ensure she catered to her assigned tables.  Her recommendations were on point and I started my night off right with the Raspberry Cosmopolitan & the roasted olives and nuts on flatbread.  Delicious!  The aroma here is divine...garlic, cheese and pizza crust!  As soon as our pizza were served, the patrons beside us had googly-eyes for the delicious pizza and wanted to know what we ordered.  Folks, the pizzas were so flavorful--one of the best I have had--with fresh veggies & savory spices. You will have a couple slices leftover for a night-time snack.  Desserts are all Italiano-based so much of it is coffee-flavored and exotic. Definitely a must try for Colorado Springs!',\n",

Pros: The service\\r Drinks were served quickly for a party of 7.\\r The Servers are quite proficient.\\r \\r Cons: The kitchen\\r Canned tomato sauce is used with no effort to cover up the taste with a seasoning blend.\\r The noodles are store-bought and undercooked.\\r The chicken is rubbery.\\r \\r Verdict: There is an evident lack of culinary knowledge in the kitchen when improperly boiled noodles are served with sauce out of a can. While the food's blandness is comparable to anything found in public school cafeterias or nursing-homes, this establishment is a great place to take a large group of people with undiscerning taste buds as the servers are amiable and patient. If you think The Godfather is an accurate depiction of Italian culture, you will probably enjoy this restaurant.\",\n",

I grew up working in excellent Italian places, so I might be a little hard to please.  I will say they always have exceptional service and I have always had good meals.  The squid ink pasta and lobster was my favorite.  Of note were the crab cake appetizers.  After living for a bit in Maryland, I quit ordering crab when not back there.  I took a gamble and ordered the crab cakes tonight.  Pretty sure they weren't blue crab, but outside of Baltimore, they were absolutely the best I've ever had; fresh real chunk crab perfectly cooked.  All in all, a solid date night spot.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'A Facade of Sophistication Served on a Plate of Disappointment. We all know the old saying: \"you can fool some of the people some of the time...\" Well, this time Biaggi\\'s Ristorante Italiano is not fooling me. This wildly popular Italian style restaurant draws a lot of out of town visitors, lunchtime business diners, and even small group patrons. It is packed on the weekends, in particular. Located in the convenient oasis of The Shoppes at Briargate among the the other themed chains and popular shopping storefronts, is what seems to be a venerable location for an always dependable meal. Sadly, things have changed. The greeting staff, comprised of two or three young ladies focused more on creating an air of exclusivity rather than getting folks to their table as efficiently as possible, are a bit too full of themselves for this typically laid-back Colorado clientele. The ambiance is somewhat upscale, though a little sterile with that distinctive \"shopping mall\" formulaic feel. I have been here about ten times over the past several years, and have noticed a decidedly steep decline in service and food quality. My wife and I were here for a \\'pre-Valentine rush\\' dinner, and so were most other diners. Our server, though genuinely well-intentioned, was stilted, confused, and struggling the entire evening. He took forever to bring us some water, then our drinks, and even jammed us with our soup and salads all at once. Clearly, he was not properly trained. I ordered the \\'Olive Me\\' martini with stuffed olives and Bombay Gin. It was way under portioned, barely reaching the middle of the glass, and missing the added vermouth I requested. The olives were a nice touch though, as all three were filled with either blue cheese, anchovies, or pepperoni. It was a welcomed twist on my usual three olive standby. My wife had a dry Californian Pinot Grigio that she thoroughly enjoyed. The special soup for the evening was a wonderful white asparagus with puréed carrots and root vegetables in a perfectly balanced cream base. Understated, bright and flavorful, it was the best part of the meal. The Caesar salad was heavily dressed, loaded with shaved Parmesan and most memorable for the undertone of biting and bitter spice from a strong, peppery chili sauce of some kind. Perhaps it appeals to the nouveau palate, but not ours. My wife\\'s sea scallops were served seared and aligned on a tiny layer of creamy risotto, flaked with crabmeat, but unfortunately ringed with an overpowering, super garlicky basil pesto that supplanted any hope of the scallop flavor from shining through. It was a heavy-handed, clumsy attempt at what should have been a better contrived dish. My eggplant Parmesan was equally disappointing. The large slices of eggplant were so thick that they did not cook through and were still green on the edges, and way over battered and too chewy to eat. The so-called tomato cream sauce, was super thick, pasty, and brash with a distinctive acidic flavor, but void of any actual cream. The topping Parmesan cheese spent too much time under the Salamander Broiler and was charred to black, instead of a more appealing light brown. Even the side of their signature Sicilian meatballs were very tough, undercooked with pink sausage pork vividly evident in the middle of one, and each needing to be ground more finely during the preparation. The concept of using what was an admittedly delicious, spicy sausage base, was ruined by terrible execution of a simple rustic meatball. The result was a complete fail on this dish. Our bill was $75 before tip, and the meal turned out to be frustratingly mediocre for a place that purports to serve sophisticated Italian fare. Others continue to flock to Biaggi\\'s, so it is entirely possible we could be missing something in the translation. But I doubt it. Salut!',\n",

This was the third time we tried this restaurant, and also the third fail! 2 of the visits, they completely screwed up the gluten free order and brought gluten filled plates. The manage came over tonight and asked to buy me a salad while I waited and my daughter ate.... We had already had salad and appetizers. It took them 30 minutes to fix the screwed up dish. Neither time did the manager apologize or take anything off the bill!!!!! The first time we went, the food was cold and the hostess was super rude. The service at this place is SLOW and poor... We tried it a third time, because once the food arrives, it is actually pretty decent. But the slow service, lack of attention and constant mistakes are not worth a return trip.',\n",

After reading so many negative reviews, I'm no longer sure that Fargos Pizza Company should be on our agenda at all.\",\n",

There were 5 of us, we were seated at a table for 4 with a chair on the end which put me into the aisle with people walking by bumping me constantly. Put in our order and waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive, during which time the server and the manager came by and apologized multiple times without us complaining about the wait. Food was marginal, I ordered the \"late night burger\" which was advertised as \"smothered\" with chile verde, when it arrived there was barely any on it, certainly not smothered. I sent the server back for more twice before it was acceptable. Then the gift card I had was run incorrectly so I had to pay cash out of pocket for no reason. I won\\'t go back to BJ\\'s at any point in the future. Not worth the trouble or expense.',\n",

From there the expeeience falls off the cliff. There were 4 of us and we all spent a great deal of time looking over the large menu. I, as is my norm, wanted to go straight for the signature of the place. It actually took some reading to figure out it was a deep dish pizza type place. I ordered BJ's favorite mini and added a Cesar salad. For being a signature dish I was grealty disappointed. There is no sauce, most if the fillings seemed under cooked and had no real flavor at all. It honestly paired right up there with a dry sandwich. The salad was okay bust some of the lettuce was slimy. My wife ordered the broccoli cheese soup. It was barely Luke warm and truthfully tasted like microwaved canned soup. By her third spoon it was cold. My sons opted for differnt choices one with a steak and the other a chicken club sandwich... lets just say the veggies and fries were cold, the mashed potatoes tasted like food service boil in a bag type and the fries had a hint of fish to them. All toll we spent $64 (no alcohol) before tip and honestly we all left feeling a bit peckish. Just wasn't impressed at all. My advice, hit noodles and company across the parking lot for an $8 thai hot pot or buttered noodles.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Demonstrably Formulaic & Perfectly Predictable Equals a Big Meh. America loves its brand names because they are familiar and consistent. Breaking into that cultural echelon is not easy for new businesses and product lines. BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is awfully familiar and reminiscent of several other similar brew pubs and houses I have frequented lately. It is built in a warehouse structure with faux side panels, garage door windows and partitions and an industrial ceiling. There is a decidedly recurring theme of the obligatory list of six or eight selections of house Pilsners, IPA's, Porters and Lagers, each described by bitterness and hoppyness and color and caramel. BTW, am I the only one who thinks $7 for a unremarkable draught beer is bit much? Methinks the charm and luster of all these supposedly exclusive craft beers has worn off, as they are becoming rather ordinary and overpriced. I can get an equally satisfying six pack of Sam Adams' for a few dollars more. The related menu typically offers some peppery calamari, spicy fries, cheesy chips, creamy pastas, and smoky meats. They all have variations on the same theme, with desperately few offering their own opus to a memorable experience. Sure, these places are fun and sociable, but they have also become routine and predictable as a springtime snow fall in Denver. I'll go down the list to satisfy those who want to know how the rundown of pub food actually measured up. The calamari, with marinara and horseradish dippers were fine, salty, crispy and made fresh to order--though a bit skimpy in portion for the price. The fettuccine with chicken and broccoli and the shrimp scampi with linguine are adequate, perfectly satisfying but certainly nothing special. The New York sirloin is a fair price and can be paired with some very good Brussels sprouts with bacon lardons. The burgers are mediocre and cooked properly, while the pulled pork is a reheated, though sufficiently tangy sandwich topped with limp onion strings and a conflictingly sweeter commercial bbq sauce that seems to clash with the more vinegary pork sopping marinade. Each of those are sided with joltingly fishy tasting skinny fries that are served cold, meaning they are not enjoyable at all. They need to rotate the fryolator oil. The all you can eat soup and salad for eight bucks is good, but the tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad was not made consistently: the first one was adroitly dressed with basil, a drizzle of a fine syrupy balsamic, and some fresh greens; the second was overpowered with an ill-advised array of thyme, cilantro and other off-putting herbs. There was no buffalo mozzarella added, and the tomatoes were not as flavorful on the second round. It was horrible, and simply not consistent. Someone has not been trained properly, to include the server who put it on our table without challenging the line cook regarding the inconsistency. The clam chowder, though jammed full of clam bits, was a little too thick with a flour based roux. The kid's pan pizza was doughy and had no sauce or topping worth mentioning. Subsequently, BJRBH barely rises above the most basic of standards for acceptable, and is simply another average franchise that will do if your hungry. Whatever.\",\n",

Due to the mixed reviews we wanted to take a look at their buffet before deciding wether or not we wanted to stay and eat here (not to mention that one of us is a vegetarian). We went in and saw that there were 3 peices of a very stale looking cheese pizza and some other pasta dishes that looked as if there had been there since lunch, we were there around 6pm. We decided not to eat there and went out to our car, to look for another place to eat. It was then that this guy came out and started starting at us. This person then said \"I noticed you guys left\". I said \"Yes we didn\\'t see any pizzas and don\\'t have time to wait and noticed 4 people in the restaurant and decided to eat somewhere else\". It was then that this guy started yelling, and approaching the open window of my vehicle, that the other people ordered their own pizzas and he was making more. Again, we didn\\'t have time. Then preceded to insult the Navy plates that are on my vehicle, and started screaming that Air Force is better. Not even sure where that came from, but whatever. Good luck to anyone that decides to eat at this establishment.',\n",

I went it, found out it was $10 more than advertised, was upset, got the pizza anyway and left. Loved the pizza (it was the Chicago style deep dish, I can't speak to their regular pizza) so I got a Groupon, the Groupon says it is a flat fee which gets you a medium two topping pizza, an appetizer and two drinks, dine-in or carry out. I called and ordered this for carry out, go to pickup my order and there was a balance, the owner wanted to charge me gratuity for my carry out order, was mad I got it for carry out, said that was an error and wanted to charge me over the amount it said it was valued at. I was appalled, showed him the Groupon, and he said it was their error and I had to pay the difference. I will never come back. If you advertise a price, you honor it.\",\n",

Found a Groupon online for this place and was immediately treated poorly by the owner because of our groupon. After ordering glasses of water we waited 20 min until the owner came back to our table. He then proceeded to interrogate us on what we were going to order and how much money we planned to spend insisting he needed to make money off of us even though the Groupon didn't state we had to spend a minimum amt of $. Had he given us a chance to order, he would have known how much we were spending. Plus, the buffet was kind of pricey for the small amount of stale food they had to offer. After 15 min of listening to the owner grill us, we finally walked out and never plan to return.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Italy is one of my favorite countries and I could easily pick up and live in the Italian countryside. The hustle and bustle of Rome, the wonderful art of Florence and I have been lucky enough to spend weeks in Tuscany. I have heard the name Dat\\'s Italian from friends and have seen it pop up on numerous social media sites lately so we headed out for a nice dinner...or so we were hoping!  \\xa0It was busy for a Wednesday night and we were told about a 20 minute wait which was not a problem. It was a glorious night out so we window shopped in Old Colorado City. When we returned they were just getting our table ready. The inside is old school 1980 style Italian decor, fairly dark, with not a lot of tables. We were seated in the back at a very tiny round table. My husband had decided on a Peroni before we even walked in the door and I settled on a nice glass of red wine. Of course they were out of Peroni. He then ordered his usual go to a Coors Light (no judging in this brew happy town haha). They were also out of that. Already a bit of a let down. He did get a Coors Banquet beer and was fine with that. My Chianti was delicious!  \\xa0We knew we were going to start with the Pignoli (aka pine nut) Meatballs. The Pignoli is an edible seed from pine cones and are used in cooking and baking and have a unique slightly nutty, slightly floral bite. We were hoping to get our appetizer first but instead got our Caesar salad first as apparently the kitchen had thrown out our ticket. Skip the Caesar here...we had spring greens (not the hearty, crunchy romaine) and it was topped with red onion and tomato (odd for a Caesar), had almost no dressing with croutons and shaved Parmesan. The one bite that I did have with dressing had a good anchovy flavor but the rest of the salad was borderline dry with no taste and too warm.  The meatballs did arrive and were the only high point of the meal. The meatballs were tender, moist, well seasoned with the wonderful flavor of the pine nuts. The red sauce was also amazing with fresh tomatoes withjust enough acidity with a hint of sweetness and the fresh basil put this over the top. They also had just enough cheese on top for that silky mouth feel. These were top notch meatballs. I just wish I would have stopped here.  I decided on the Shrimp Puttanesca, which translates literally In Italian to \"spaghetti in the style of a prostitute\".\\xa0 Our waiter asked if I liked spicy and of course I said yes....extra spicy! The dish traditionally has anchovy, garlic, Kalamata olives, red pepper flakes, fresh diced tomatoes, capers, and parsley and this one also had Pecorino cheese,lemon and onions and tossed with Bowtie pasta instead of the traditional spaghetti, which was fine. I was first informed they ran out of Bowtie pasta. I selected the fresh pasta instead. I could smell the garlic from the kitchen...a smell I love. Until I took my first bite. I love salt and garlic but the salt and garlic on this dish was inedible. My husband took a bite and spit it out. I was SO glad I didn\\'t salt it first figuring it wouldn\\'t need any with the capers, anchovy and kalamata olives but salt it someone did. The garlic overpowered everything on this dish. I did eat 3 bites, no heat, and called it a day. The shrimp I did taste were cooked perfectly but they had soaked up all that salt and garlic. It was $20 down the drain and only the 2nd dish in history that I declared inedible. HORRIBLE!  After reading review after review on the lasagna and on the recommendation of our waiter that is what my husband ordered. We certainly didn\\'t declare it the best lasagna ever but it was average. The tomato sauce was the best part but way too much cheese (and it takes a lot to write down those words) and the overcooked pasta made it for a very one note dish. Had the pasta been al dente for that nice contrasting bite with all the soft cheese that would have upped the game a bit, but instead it sat like a ton of bricks, but hey, at least it was edible!  \\xa0We were disappointed to say the least.',\n",

Most restaurants I see people working together and maybe socializing, but the aura and vibes here are great! The food is absolutely delicious; I have tried so many different items and never know which one to choose the next time since they all are so good. The beers on tap are always rotating and always fun to try. Couldn't really ask for more!\",\n",

The Jambalaya is almost $17 but based on portion size and flavor it shouldn't cost more then $14. The pizza is average - flavors are all really great but crust is kinda dry. Macaroni bites suck! They are not even close to the Cheesecake Factory ones. We really enjoy all the pasta dishes and would consider CPK a place we would eat at every few months.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': \"Still Mediocre After All These Years. We have not eaten at the California Pizza Kitchen in about three years. We stopped going there because my wife and I considered the food overpriced and underwhelming. Generally, that remains our impression of CPK 's current offerings. The field green salad was underdressed, bland, and needed some tang. The sweet walnuts were very good though. The Bolognese was skimpy on the sauce, too light and bright for what supposed to be a hearty, rich dish. It had no depth of flavor, lacked garlic, and the pasta was actually way too al dente and almost inedible. The wild mushroom pizza was dominated with fresh basil and a pungent wild mushroom flavor. It was surprisingly bold but did not balance with the near tasteless crust. The five cheese pizza was good, but also needed some salt and pepper and maybe some oregano to round it out. I tried their pricey sangria and it was refreshing..not to mention pricey. CPK's prices are still astronomical for what they serve you, and we were once again reminded why we do not like the food, nor consider their prices a value for the average family. We will not return anytime soon.\",\n",

       "        'review_text': 'Decent for California-style Pizza. My wife and I have been to a CPK before. You can expect a trendy interior, a large, varied menu and a formal waitstaff. \\r \\r The CPK specializes in \"personalized\" pizza\\'s that ring in around 12\" in diameter and have toppings you wouldn\\'t normally find at other pizza places. Just look at my Thai pizza for example. No tomato sauce here, instead, it\\'s a peanut sauce. It comes with scallions, chicken, sprouts, etc. It was pretty tasty with all of the flavors going nicely and reminding me of, guess what, Pad Thai.\\r \\r My wife\\'s 3 topping pizza was also pretty good. The sauce was just enough and had the traditional California style sweet sauce. The sausage had nice, noticeable fennel seeds in it, which made it seem more premium.\\r \\r I like their traditional crust, which was crunchy and very chewy with a slight hint of sweetness to it. I really enjoyed it. And best of all, it wasn\\'t dusted with that damn corn meal like Extreme Pizza does.\\r \\r I\\'d recommend CPK to people who would insist on a chain restaurant, but also because I don\\'t believe there is a local pizza joint that specializes in California Style pizza in the Springs.',\n",

It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Somewhat cramped. Our server was extremely quiet, but he was attentive and pleasant. Laughed at our stupid jokes. Did not come back with proper change for a smart tip. Food was fairly good! Elk burger wasn't dry and served medium as requested, and the reuben was packed with meat. We enjoyed the calamari, but the portion size was a bit small for the price. Moscow mule was decent with the choice of vodka, though it seemed a bit watery. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was very comfortable temperature wise inside - important summer info in a rare-AC environment!\",\n",

Service was adequate and prices are good. The food is average. We split stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, stuffed with imitation crab and topped with melted swiss. Not bad, and I would have them again. My husband had a bison burger and I had an elk burger. Both were cooked a little more than we would have liked them (ordered medium rare, much more a medium to medium well), but they were edible and ok. I had the salad bar, which was a basic salad bar with romaine, olives, broccoli, tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, beets and a choice of dressings. My daughter really ate most of my salad bar plate, broccoli and tomatoes in ranch. She had the kids chicken strips and fries. Two large pieces of chicken lightly breaded that was actually pretty decent for a kids meal. My husband had onion rings with his meal and they were as expected. My husband and I also both had a beer from the local Estes Park Brewery.  Overall I likely won't go back because there are still other places in Estes Park we haven't tried yet, but we did branch out from our usual spots we eat. I don't regret it, but I can now cross it off the list.\",\n",

Ordered Fried Calamari appetizer which came with a chunky tomato sauce and both the calamari and the sauce were great... then dinner came... Got the special sampler with lasagna, a ravioli, and spaghetti. The sauce was the most disgusting tomato sauce I have ever had... It tasted similar but worse than a can of Campbell's tomato soup and had a watery consistency. Everything was bland with very few herbs or salt or anything. The lasagna was better than ravioli or spaghetti, but would never eat it again. If I ever visit Fort Collins again, I will not be coming here.\",\n",

However, any combination you order from here will fulfill your hangry (hungry + angry) needs. As I sit at one of Justine's comfortable booths, I am reflecting on one of their most popular pizzas that I just ate. The Justine's special is just delectable. It has savory beef, sausage and pepperoni as well as mushroom, buttery-like black olives and sweet onion. All of these ingredients combine to make a combustion of flavor once it hits your taste buds. The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and cooked to perfection to a golden color. I highly recommend this place! I could go on and on!\",\n",

You won't get a heavy, greasy pizza like most places. They have a great array of toppings, a gluten free crust option (but not a gluten-free environment) and some great lunch specials. The service is very friendly and fast, my only complaint is I wish they offered a bigger variety of specialty pizzas, but they are relatively new so I hope to see that in the future. Keep doing what you are doing!\",\n",

Many months ago (as in, October ), Jenny, who writes Choice City Native and I had a meeting to chat over coffee. She had introduced herself when I spoke about being a Professional Blogger at Beet Street's Art Cafe and suggested we go out for coffee sometime. I thought that was a fabulous idea, especially since I cannot shut up about how much I love blogging, and here I had someone who was willing to listen (not to mention someone who understood what blogging was all about!). In this coffee talk, Jenny came up with the idea to do a review together. It took getting over the holidays to finally pull it all together, but we did, and ended up going to Carousel Dinner Theater to see Smokey Joe's Cafe . I couldn't have been more excited, because this is somewhere I've wanted to go ever since they opened after renovations earlier this year...\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

Can not call the restaurant to order -- have to use Order UP-- delivery took 1 hour and 48 minutes (with a 60 minute forecast when ordered); Thru the Order UP -- not clear on how to order our preference on crust; Pizza was cold when delivered; Manager at Beau Jo's did not care -- offered a $10 refund on a $65 order. Too many better places for pizza; we are regular Sunday nite pizza customers and will not go back to Beau Jo's;\",\n",

On September 18th 2014 the food was okay but not as good as I remember it. Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I'm retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID's to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID's in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else's drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \\\"upiddy\\\" to cater to \\\"older\\\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that's what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.\",\n",

So one day we decided to try it out for lunch. \\r We were shown to our table by a hostess who seemed like she had dozens of better things to do (it was not busy), five minutes later a server appeared to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

I had their \\\"favorite\\\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \\\"butter\\\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry's just down the block.\",\n",

We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",

It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Our server was extremely quiet, but he was attentive and pleasant. Laughed at our stupid jokes. Did not come back with proper change for a smart tip. Food was fairly good! Elk burger wasn't dry and served medium as requested, and the reuben was packed with meat. We enjoyed the calamari, but the portion size was a bit small for the price. Moscow mule was decent with the choice of vodka, though it seemed a bit watery. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was very comfortable temperature wise inside - important summer info in a rare-AC environment!\",\n",

Service was adequate and prices are good. The food is average. We split stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, stuffed with imitation crab and topped with melted swiss. Not bad, and I would have them again. My husband had a bison burger and I had an elk burger. Both were cooked a little more than we would have liked them (ordered medium rare, much more a medium to medium well), but they were edible and ok. I had the salad bar, which was a basic salad bar with romaine, olives, broccoli, tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, beets and a choice of dressings. My daughter really ate most of my salad bar plate, broccoli and tomatoes in ranch. She had the kids chicken strips and fries. Two large pieces of chicken lightly breaded that was actually pretty decent for a kids meal. My husband had onion rings with his meal and they were as expected. My husband and I also both had a beer from the local Estes Park Brewery.  Overall I likely won\\'t go back because there are still other places in Estes Park we haven\\'t tried yet, but we did branch out from our usual spots we eat. I don\\'t regret it, but I can now cross it off the list.',\n",

We talked to the couple across from us and they had a steak but only ate a quarter of it, stated it was all fat and not good.  We all left very disappointed.  I'm never going there again...  avoid this place would be my recommendation.\",\n",

Got the special sampler with lasagna, a ravioli, and spaghetti. The sauce was the most disgusting tomato sauce I have ever had... It tasted similar but worse than a can of Campbell's tomato soup and had a watery consistency. Everything was bland with very few herbs or salt or anything. The lasagna was better than ravioli or spaghetti, but would never eat it again. If I ever visit Fort Collins again, I will not be coming here.\",\n",

However, any combination you order from here will fulfill your hangry (hungry + angry) needs. As I sit at one of Justine's comfortable booths, I am reflecting on one of their most popular pizzas that I just ate. The Justine's special is just delectable. It has savory beef, sausage and pepperoni as well as mushroom, buttery-like black olives and sweet onion. All of these ingredients combine to make a combustion of flavor once it hits your taste buds. The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and cooked to perfection to a golden color. I highly recommend this place! I could go on and on!\",\n",

The service is very friendly and fast, my only complaint is I wish they offered a bigger variety of specialty pizzas, but they are relatively new so I hope to see that in the future.

She had introduced herself when I spoke about being a Professional Blogger at Beet Street's Art Cafe and suggested we go out for coffee sometime. I thought that was a fabulous idea, especially since I cannot shut up about how much I love blogging, and here I had someone who was willing to listen (not to mention someone who understood what blogging was all about!). In this coffee talk, Jenny came up with the idea to do a review together. It took getting over the holidays to finally pull it all together, but we did, and ended up going to Carousel Dinner Theater to see Smokey Joe's Cafe . I couldn't have been more excited, because this is somewhere I've wanted to go ever since they opened after renovations earlier this year...\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

Too many better places for pizza; we are regular Sunday nite pizza customers and will not go back to Beau Jo's;\",\n",

Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I\\'m retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID\\'s to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID\\'s in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else\\'s drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \"upiddy\" to cater to \"older\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that\\'s what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.',\n",

So one day we decided to try it out for lunch. \\r We were shown to our table by a hostess who seemed like she had dozens of better things to do (it was not busy), five minutes later a server appeared to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We think they misplaced our order or something, because the people next to us got their food, ate and left before we even GOT our pizza. Indeed, it took an hour to get our food. We only had an hour to eat and go, so we basically got our food and had it boxed. Later (when I actually tried my food), I found that the inside of the \"braided\" crust was raw! As in completely uncooked pizza dough, the outside of which was barely even toasty! NOT the best of experiences, to say the least.',\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

I had their \"favorite\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \"butter\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry\\'s just down the block.',\n",

We sent it back and it was returned extremely rare, practically raw. We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",
