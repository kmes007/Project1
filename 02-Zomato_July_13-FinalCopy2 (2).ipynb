It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Elk burger wasn't dry and served medium as requested, and the reuben was packed with meat. We enjoyed the calamari, but the portion size was a bit small for the price. Moscow mule was decent with the choice of vodka, though it seemed a bit watery. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was very comfortable temperature wise inside - important summer info in a rare-AC environment!\",\n",

Service was adequate and prices are good. The food is average. We split stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, stuffed with imitation crab and topped with melted swiss. Not bad, and I would have them again. My husband had a bison burger and I had an elk burger. Both were cooked a little more than we would have liked them (ordered medium rare, much more a medium to medium well), but they were edible and ok. I had the salad bar, which was a basic salad bar with romaine, olives, broccoli, tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, beets and a choice of dressings. My daughter really ate most of my salad bar plate, broccoli and tomatoes in ranch. She had the kids chicken strips and fries. Two large pieces of chicken lightly breaded that was actually pretty decent for a kids meal. My husband had onion rings with his meal and they were as expected. My husband and I also both had a beer from the local Estes Park Brewery.  Overall I likely won't go back because there are still other places in Estes Park we haven't tried yet, but we did branch out from our usual spots we eat. I don't regret it, but I can now cross it off the list.\",\n",

It tasted similar but worse than a can of Campbell's tomato soup and had a watery consistency. Everything was bland with very few herbs or salt or anything. The lasagna was better than ravioli or spaghetti, but would never eat it again. If I ever visit Fort Collins again, I will not be coming here.\",\n",

However, any combination you order from here will fulfill your hangry (hungry + angry) needs. As I sit at one of Justine's comfortable booths, I am reflecting on one of their most popular pizzas that I just ate. The Justine's special is just delectable. It has savory beef, sausage and pepperoni as well as mushroom, buttery-like black olives and sweet onion. All of these ingredients combine to make a combustion of flavor once it hits your taste buds. The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and cooked to perfection to a golden color. I highly recommend this place! I could go on and on!\",\n",

You won't get a heavy, greasy pizza like most places. They have a great array of toppings, a gluten free crust option (but not a gluten-free environment) and some great lunch specials. The service is very friendly and fast, my only complaint is I wish they offered a bigger variety of specialty pizzas, but they are relatively new so I hope to see that in the future. Keep doing what you are doing!\",\n",

Many months ago (as in, October ), Jenny, who writes Choice City Native and I had a meeting to chat over coffee. She had introduced herself when I spoke about being a Professional Blogger at Beet Street's Art Cafe and suggested we go out for coffee sometime. I thought that was a fabulous idea, especially since I cannot shut up about how much I love blogging, and here I had someone who was willing to listen (not to mention someone who understood what blogging was all about!). In this coffee talk, Jenny came up with the idea to do a review together. It took getting over the holidays to finally pull it all together, but we did, and ended up going to Carousel Dinner Theater to see Smokey Joe's Cafe . I couldn't have been more excited, because this is somewhere I've wanted to go ever since they opened after renovations earlier this year...\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

On September 18th 2014 the food was okay but not as good as I remember it. Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I'm retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID's to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID's in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else's drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \\\"upiddy\\\" to cater to \\\"older\\\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that's what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.\",\n",

So one day we decided to try it out for lunch. \\r We were shown to our table by a hostess who seemed like she had dozens of better things to do (it was not busy), five minutes later a server appeared to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

It is served with homemade garlic bread which is crispy on the outside & tender inside ad enhances the dip... Best portobello mushroom ravioli... All pasta is fresh - homemade in the restaurant... Fettuccine with pesto and crispy chicken was amazing as well as the Old World Spaghetti- highly recommend- reminiscent of dishes in Italy!!! Resonant prices as well!\",\n",

We tried to explain the bill add up but the owner very rudely responded and didnt agree to serve us. We asked them to show the bill register but that was refused to us.

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

I had their \\\"favorite\\\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \\\"butter\\\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry's just down the block.\",\n",

It came out literally mooing at us. We sent it back and it was returned extremely rare, practically raw. We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",

It is a bit off the beaten path but I am very glad we stopped by. Very charming atmosphere and great specials on bottles of wine for the winter. I split a ribeye steak and lasagna, both were amazing. The steak and garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I took a leap of faith off of a reccomendation with the lasagna. As an Italian I am very picky with my lasagna but this was-dare I say it- better than my grandma's! The sauce was very flavorful and paired perfectly with the egg noodles. For dessert we ended with an Irish coffee (very strong!), a cheesecake, a canoli (my favorite, the ricotta was so fresh!) And a butterscotch panna cotta (so creamy and good, I don't normally go for butterscotch but this was fantastic. ) We will definitely be coming back!\",\n",

Our server was extremely quiet, but he was attentive and pleasant. Laughed at our stupid jokes. Did not come back with proper change for a smart tip. Food was fairly good! Elk burger wasn't dry and served medium as requested, and the reuben was packed with meat. We enjoyed the calamari, but the portion size was a bit small for the price. Moscow mule was decent with the choice of vodka, though it seemed a bit watery. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was very comfortable temperature wise inside - important summer info in a rare-AC environment!\",\n",

Service was adequate and prices are good. The food is average. We split stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, stuffed with imitation crab and topped with melted swiss. Not bad, and I would have them again. My husband had a bison burger and I had an elk burger. Both were cooked a little more than we would have liked them (ordered medium rare, much more a medium to medium well), but they were edible and ok. I had the salad bar, which was a basic salad bar with romaine, olives, broccoli, tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, beets and a choice of dressings. My daughter really ate most of my salad bar plate, broccoli and tomatoes in ranch. She had the kids chicken strips and fries. Two large pieces of chicken lightly breaded that was actually pretty decent for a kids meal. My husband had onion rings with his meal and they were as expected. My husband and I also both had a beer from the local Estes Park Brewery.  Overall I likely won\\'t go back because there are still other places in Estes Park we haven\\'t tried yet, but we did branch out from our usual spots we eat. I don\\'t regret it, but I can now cross it off the list.',\n",

However, any combination you order from here will fulfill your hangry (hungry + angry) needs. As I sit at one of Justine's comfortable booths, I am reflecting on one of their most popular pizzas that I just ate. The Justine's special is just delectable. It has savory beef, sausage and pepperoni as well as mushroom, buttery-like black olives and sweet onion. All of these ingredients combine to make a combustion of flavor once it hits your taste buds. The crust is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and cooked to perfection to a golden color. I highly recommend this place! I could go on and on!\",\n",

The service is very friendly and fast, my only complaint is I wish they offered a bigger variety of specialty pizzas, but they are relatively new so I hope to see that in the future.

       "        'review_text': \"Some of the best ideas happen over a cup of coffee. That's actually how this whole guest blogging/co-review feature week came together. Many months ago (as in, October ), Jenny, who writes Choice City Native and I had a meeting to chat over coffee. She had introduced herself when I spoke about being a Professional Blogger at Beet Street's Art Cafe and suggested we go out for coffee sometime. I thought that was a fabulous idea, especially since I cannot shut up about how much I love blogging, and here I had someone who was willing to listen (not to mention someone who understood what blogging was all about!). In this coffee talk, Jenny came up with the idea to do a review together. It took getting over the holidays to finally pull it all together, but we did, and ended up going to Carousel Dinner Theater to see Smokey Joe's Cafe . I couldn't have been more excited, because this is somewhere I've wanted to go ever since they opened after renovations earlier this year...\",\n",

Being from the east coast I know what this kind of pizza should taste like. The problem is the service is terrible and the atmosphere is shot. It was ok when it opened but it just has a let it go feel to it, almost kind of dirty. Last time there I sat down and tried to order the special on the board. The waitress said that's not the special that's from the other day. Ok, it's written in chalk, there's two people in the restaurant, it's already 2pm way past lunch with staff standing around and your too lazy to erase to put the actual special on the board. This is service 101, I've opened numerous restaurants over the years and it doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service stinks you're going down in flames. Probably wouldn't go back and the sad part is I like the pizza.\",\n",

Service was AWFUL!!! It was so bad I have contacted cooperate. I\\'m retired military and the young man (very young looking maybe 19) who served us refused to wait on me after he denied my brother in law a beer for having an out of state temporary ID. First of all if your a college town maybe you should do research on out of state ID\\'s to know which ones are valid and not valid. Afterwards he was so afraid to wait on us for saying no to a beer that he refused to come back and get my drink order along with my sister. WE sat there with ID\\'s in hand waiting. I was so mortified because I had talked this place up and dragged my Sister, Brother in law, Uncle, and Grandpa there. All of us were over the age of 30. Youngest person at the table was 30!!!! I tried to get the managers attention and the waiter he looked at me and walked away! If your not going to serve an adult beer because your afraid of an out of state LEGAL ID with a picture the least you can do is get everybody else\\'s drink order instead of running away and ignoring the table all together! obviously this place to \"upiddy\" to cater to \"older\" people and maybe the college students working there only care about other college students. Honestly that\\'s what it looked like to me. FYI manager was flirting with female staff who also looked young and naive he did not care about the service WE received. I will never go back and spread the WORD.',\n",

So one day we decided to try it out for lunch. \\r We were shown to our table by a hostess who seemed like she had dozens of better things to do (it was not busy), five minutes later a server appeared to ask us what we wanted to drink. We were in no hurry so though we noted the service we brushed it off. I ordered a cranberry salad and my husband ordered the Beaugetti Pizza (deep dish with spaghetti and meatballs).\\r The dough was cooked separately, pasta loaded in so it really shouldn't have taken long. Prepwise it didn't. Our server however left it at the window to take and full a drink order for a table that came after us, then brought them their food.\\r When we finally got our food it was bland, I mean ice berg lettuce hidden under a cap of mixed greens, and undoctored red sauce from a can bland. The only thing either of us could say we enjoyed from the experience was the outer crust of the pizza pie.\",\n",

We think they misplaced our order or something, because the people next to us got their food, ate and left before we even GOT our pizza. Indeed, it took an hour to get our food. We only had an hour to eat and go, so we basically got our food and had it boxed. Later (when I actually tried my food), I found that the inside of the \"braided\" crust was raw! As in completely uncooked pizza dough, the outside of which was barely even toasty! NOT the best of experiences, to say the least.',\n",

My favorite pie is a custom: ricotta, sausage, and spinach. Mouth-watering delicious.',\n",

We have lived in Loveland, CO for 6 years now, and I can say that this is the WORST MEAL we have had here. Ordering was an ORDEAL; 20 minutes of searching online for BASIC INFORMATION like a MENU, A PHONE #, HOURS? Chalk it up to A busy day/busy hour. Mother's Day. Must have caught them by surprise, right? The pie itself was an out-sized disk maybe half-covered with the sparsest of ingredients, smeared with pink sauce, and little evidence of cheese and no herbs. It was cold upon pick-up, and our oven (ready at 200 degrees) was no help. The price was absolutely ABSURDLY high. An ALL-OUT DISASTER. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM!\",\n",

The first time in, my wife had chicken marsala, and I had pasta with the Italian sausage. Both were very good, and the homemade buns we're delicious. We had great service,so we decided to go back this year. Again, it was great. I don't know why I'm seeing bad reviews here. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Estes Park.\",\n",

We finished the 10 inch pizza and had only one plate of chicken tenders given, we asked for the other one but we were told that we ordered 14 inch pizza and 1 chicken tenders. We tried to explain the bill add up but the owner very rudely responded and didnt agree to serve us. We asked them to show the bill register but that was refused to us. He kept saying you have eaten the pizza so I cant believe you.And he was very rude in his behaviour.',\n",

It's one think to ask patrons not to dance, but it's another thing to yell at them and tell them you will get them arrested at a bar where dancing previously occurred every weekend. Sadly, the manager Christina had zero concern for how badly the short male waiter with a balding spot was treating everyone. The manager claimed that we could not dance in places where we blocked the aisles, but they still made us stop dancing even when we moved out of everyone's way. The short male waiter with a balding spot was talking down and ugly to over a dozen tables. I will never go back! My friends and I were previously weekly customers. I hope your staff is proud of themselves... especially when their business starts to decline significantly over the next few weeks! Wish there was an option for zero stars for this review, but there is not.\",\n",

The atmosphere is relaxed and it fits well into the downtown night life.\\r \\r But eating, is not nearly as interesting to me (or my family). I had their \"favorite\" Fish & Chips, which although moist, was disappointingly flavorless. The kids pizza was not good at all, and neither the kids nor adults enjoyed the cheap cardboard (overcooked pita) crust and cheddar cheese... My wife went top of the line with the \"butter\" steak, which was as you begin to suspect, not buttery at all. Hers was no better than a tough sirloin, once again with very little flavor.\\r \\r The sweet potato fries is a nice alternative, but these tasted old and slightly stale - much prefer those of Henry\\'s just down the block.',\n",

We sent it back and it was returned extremely rare, practically raw. We sent it back once more and when it was brought back, it was without question, so over done it was almost unedible. I say almost, but for the price they were charging, we gave it the college try. My dish, the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni, well, lets just say that I'm still looking for the crab. It looked as if it was frozen food put into their own dishes. The service was good and the server was obviously embarrassed as he took 10 dollars off the ticket. We will NEVER return.\",\n",
