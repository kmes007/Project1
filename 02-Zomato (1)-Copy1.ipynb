Possibly if you sit near the bar and remind your server to keep thing moving and bring the check with the meal and take the payment at the same time. Food wise...They have a pork carnitas breakfast that is really good, their green chili is flavorful -New Mexico Style, and they have good bloody mary's. Today I picked up their burrito bowl from their grab-n-go area, they were happy to add two types of meat for an up charge. \\u00a0Written by Dr.DP\",\n",

The bread was HUGE and SUPER soft, and the other ingredients extremely fresh as well. The Cajun sauce packs a little punch, which really adds to the flavor. So glad I stopped by! Highly recommended!.\",\n",

The large bar is inviting with great beers on tap and the one thing that remains constant is their customer base. Don't let the long line scare you away, there is a reason for it - their food taste great and portions are grande (large). The line moves quick - they're used to it. My personal favorite is the breakfast burrito with eggs, beef, and pork! Mmmmmm!\",\n",

They definitely don\\'t have the \"giddy-up gene\" if you\\'re in a hurry. Possibly if you sit near the bar and remind your server to keep thing moving and bring the check with the meal and take the payment at the same time. Food wise...They have a pork carnitas breakfast that is really good, their green chili is flavorful -New Mexico Style, and they have good bloody mary\\'s. Today I picked up their burrito bowl from their grab-n-go area, they were happy to add two types of meat for an up charge. \\xa0Written by Dr.DP',\n",

Usually there's football or baseball on the televisions without sound.  If your lucky they will have a special small release batch of beer or one of their lips of faith Series beers.  They will even go off menu and create a dish to your kids desire.  I know, who does that?  These guys...recommended.\",\n",
